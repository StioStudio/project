        <h2>About:</h3>
        This is is something I have made before in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/471905937/">Scratch</a>. Even though I am still proud of the optimizations on it, I wanted faster! <br>
        <div class="line white"></div>
        So some years later (now) I made this. A prime number generator that uses the prime numbers them self to be faster. How you ask? <br>
        <div class="line white"></div>
        (If you can javascript code then you can read here: <a href="./index.js">code</a>) <br>
        When you divide a number by 2 example and you get a decimal. You will get a decimal when dividing on the same number with 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 or 12........or 214912476.....You get the point. This makes it so that you only need to divide the numbers with primes to find if the number is prime. That is how I optimized the this code. <br>
        <div class="line white"></div>
        If you know any other optimizations please let me know tell me ðŸ˜º
