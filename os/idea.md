# The idea

Only windows (not supported of any other operating system).
Programs (exe) will be made thrue JS. The JS will be runned in an default export.
The JS can be system or program.
System will be in the back, and will not have any box (window). It will be hiden from the taskbar.
Program will have a box. It will be shown in the taskbar.
Both system and program will be able to make boxes though. 
You can do this to the box: maximize, minimize, resize, move, hide, close
